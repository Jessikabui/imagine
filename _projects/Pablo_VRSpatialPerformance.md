Previous studies have found that exist divergences in performance during the development of spatial navigation tasks between VR displays with different technological characteristics. We can highlight three display factors as the main contributors to produce differences in spatial performance: ﬁeld of view, display resolution and relative lightness. These factors can inﬂuence the effective navigation on different degrees, which is a challenge for the development of asymmetric collaborative virtual environments. The project is focused in the development of a set of transfer functions to approximate spatial performance between hetereogeneous virtual reality displays.
