title: Interpretable and Interactive Machine Learning

description: Did you obtain a high-performance for your machine learning model but you are not able to explain how your black-box model solves that specific task? How can someone make decisions then? In a similar way, what about if your automatic model need to be incorporated in an application used by multiple users requiring interact with the data and the backstage model in real time? It would be a shame that your powerful model could not be deployed in environments where additional requirements to high performance need to be meet.
